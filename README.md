# Hyper's website

You found the source code backing Hyper's website hosted at https://tableau.github.io/hyper-db ðŸ™‚

If you want to read our documentation or any other content from our webpage, I highly recommend you do so on https://tableau.github.io/hyper-db instead of browsing the source code here.
If, however, you want to contribute to our documentation, e.g. by documenting new use cases, fixing typos, writing a blog post, then you found exactly the right spot.
Contributions are very welcome, you don't need to be a Salesforce employee.
Just open a pull request on this Github repository.
For larger contributions, however, you might want to create a [Github issue](https://github.com/tableau/hyper-db/issues) first, to discuss your idea.

### Installation
