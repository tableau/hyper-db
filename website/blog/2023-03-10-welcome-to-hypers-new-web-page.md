"Tableau HyperAPI" has been around for almost 3.5 years now, and its time for a reboot:
Today we are launching our new, modernized web presence, including a new langing page, re-juvenated documentation and a new blog (which you already found, if you are reaging this :smile:)

Story of Hyper: Roots in research, acquired by Tableau, replaced TDE, onboarded new use cases like Tableau Prep, acquired by Salesforce, expanding to new scenarios.

Use cases:
* Tableau integration
* datascientist: similar to DuckDB
* researchers as baseline to benchmark against

Source code for our documentation is now hosted on Github. Feel free to contribute!

Samples are also on Github.
