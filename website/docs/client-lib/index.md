# Client library

Hyper ships together with its client library called "Hyper API".
Hyper API provides convenience functions to:

* start and stop a Hyper process and connect to it
* format SQL queries while correctly escaping strings etc.
* create, modify, delete and inspect the schemas/tables/columns inside a Hyper database

The client library is available in Python, C++, Java and .Net.
