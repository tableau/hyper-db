## Why does HyperAPI only have `0.0.*` versions?

No worries, our `0.0.*` versioning scheme does not imply that Hyper is still in a pre-alpha version. In fact, Hyper has been battle-proven at Tableau for many years.

Our versioning scheme comes from the Tableau release numbers, where e.g. 2023.1.2 is the second patch version of the first release in the year 2023. With Hyper API, we are releasing new versions more frequently than the Tableau releases. Since there are no directly corresponding Tableau releases to our Hyper releases, we just decided to use `0.0.*` versions for Hyper API.
