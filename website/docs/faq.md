# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who is behind Hyper?

Hyper and Hyper API are developed by the Hyper team at Salesforce / Tableau and powers large parts of Tableau's analytical experience.
Our team has a strong research background because Hyper originally started as a research project, and many of the original founders of Hyper are still with the project.

## How is Hyper related to HyPer?

Hyper started a research project at Technische Universität München. Back then, the project was still called "HyPer", the "P" was lower-cased soon after the aquisition in 2016.
You can still find find links to all the research paper on [HyPer's website](https://hyper-db.de/).
The code base of Hyper is an evolution of the research project HyPer and many of the foundational papers of HyPer are still applicable.
For more information on Hyper's journey, see [Our Journey](/journey)

## Why does HyperAPI only have `0.0.*` versions?

No worries, our `0.0.*` versioning scheme does not imply that Hyper is still in a pre-alpha version. In fact, Hyper has been battle-proven at Tableau for many years.

Our versioning scheme comes from the Tableau release numbers, where e.g. 2023.1.2 is the second patch version of the first release in the year 2023. With Hyper API, we are releasing new versions more frequently than the Tableau releases. Since there are no directly corresponding Tableau releases to our Hyper releases, we just decided to use `0.0.*` versions for Hyper API.
