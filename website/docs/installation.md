# Installation


```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
```

Hyper API is available for Python, C++, Java and .NET supporting Windows, Mac and Linux each.
Depending on the language, the installation can be complex.
This page contains the detailed requirements and installation instructions for all languages.

## Hardware requirements

The Hyper API only supports 64-bit platforms. 
It has the following minimum hardware requirements:

- Intel Nehalem or AMD Bulldozer processor or newer
- 2 GB memory
- 1.5 GB minimum free disk space

```mdx-code-block
import { AppleSiliconWorkarounds } from "@site/src/components/AppleSiliconWorkarounds.tsx";

<AppleSiliconWorkarounds />
```

## Supported platforms

- macOS 10.13 or newer
- Microsoft Windows 8 or newer (64-bit)
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016, 2012, 2012 R2, 2008 R2, 2019
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS
- Amazon Linux 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.3+ and 8.3+, CentOS 7.9+, Oracle Linux 7.3+

## Language-specific Requirements

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs queryString="client-language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

* **[Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** (or newer) is required.
  - Install the 64-bit version (for example, for Windows, the download is listed as `Windows x86-64`).
  - On Windows, we recommend to select the option **Add Python 3.x to PATH** during installation.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cxx" label="C++">
```

* The C++ headers use C++11, so a **standard-compliant compiler with thorough C++11 support** is required. Our internal testing is done with the newest Clang.

:::tip
Using at least C++17 is recommended, as the API uses C++17 classes, such as `std::optional` and `std::string_view`. If the headers are compiled with a standard older than C++17, interface-compatible classes of the API will be used instead.
:::

* For the examples, a CMake project file is provided. To build it, **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)** must be installed on your computer and available in your PATH.
  * On Windows, you also need Visual Studio 2015 (or newer).

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
```

* **[JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)** (or newer) is required.

## Instructions

```mdx-code-block

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

:::note
The following instructions assume that you have set up a virtual environment for Python. For more information on creating virtual environments, see [venv - Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in the Python Standard Library.
:::

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `venv` directory.

1. Install the **[tableauhyperapi](https://pypi.org/project/tableauhyperapi/)** module using **pip**.

    ```
    pip install tableauhyperapi
    ```

    If you previously installed the `tableauhyperapi`, you can upgrade to the latest version using the following command.

    ```
    pip install --upgrade tableauhyperapi
    ```

    :::warning
    Linux installations require `pip` version 19.3 or newer. Note that `pip` versions 20.0 and 20.1 are not working because of issues with `pip`.
    :::

    Alternatively, you can [download](/docs/releases#download) the Python **Hyper API wheel package (`.whl` file)** for your operating system. Use `pip` to install the `.whl` file you downloaded.
      * On Windows: `Scripts\pip install [*path_to_whl_file*]`
      * On Linux/macOS: `bin/pip install [*path_to_whl_file*]`

1. Try out the examples:
    - Download the [samples from Github](https://github.com/tableau/hyper-api-samples).
    - Run the Python examples (for example, try `insert_data_into_single_table.py`).
        - On Windows:
        `[venv_directory]\Scripts\python hyper-api-samples\Tableau-Supported\Python\insert_data_into_single_table.py`
        - On Linux/macOS:
        `[venv_directory]/bin/python hyper-api-samples/Tableau-Supported/Python/insert_data_into_single_table.py`

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cxx" label="C++">
```

1. [Download](/docs/releases#download) the C++ Hyper API package file (`.zip` file) for your operating system.

1. Unzip the Hyper API package file to a convenient location.

1. To build and run the examples on the command line:
    - Open a terminal. On Windows, open the **VS2019 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt**.
    - Navigate into the `examples` directory of the extracted C++ Hyper API package.
    - Configure the project with `cmake`:
        - On Windows: `cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019 Win64" .`
        - On Linux/macOS: `cmake .`
    - Build the examples:
        - On Windows: `cmake --build . --config Debug`
          or `cmake --build . --config Release`
        - On Linux/macOS: `cmake --build .`
    - Run the examples
        - On Windows: `ctest --verbose -C Debug`
          or `ctest --verbose -C Release`
        - On Linux/macOS: `ctest --verbose`

1. To build and run the examples in Visual Studio, go to **File > Open > Folder** and select the `examples` directory of the `tableauhyperapi-cxx` package.

1. If you want to build your own applications, you need to install the Hyper API library on your computer. To do this:
    - On Windows: Append the extracted bin directory to your system `PATH` variable.
    - On Linux: Append the extracted lib directory to your system `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.
    - On macOS: You need to include the lib directory as `RPATH` for every binary.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
```

1. [Download](/docs/releases#download) the Java Hyper API package file (`.zip` file) for your operating system.

1. Unzip the Hyper API package file to a convenient location.

1. To build and run the examples on the command line:
    - Open a terminal and navigate into the `examples` directory of the extracted Java Hyper API package.
    - Build the examples: `gradle build`
    - Run the examples: `gradle run`

1. You can import the example project into IntelliJ or Eclipse:
    - IntelliJ:
        - Import the Hyper API into IntelliJ by opening the `build.gradle` file from the unzipped Hyper API package.
        - In the **Gradle** view, choose an example and select **Tasks > application > run**.
    - Eclipse:
        - You need to have a recent version of Eclipse installed to use Gradle.
        - Import the Hyper API into Eclipse as an existing Gradle project (**File > Import > Gradle > Existing Gradle Project**).
        - Select the directory of the unzipped Hyper API package as the "Project root directory".
        - Select **Override workspace settings** in the "Import Options" dialog and use at least Gradle version 5.5.
        - In the **Gradle Tasks** view, choose an example and select **application > run**.

1. You can create new projects that use the Hyper API in IntelliJ or Eclipse:
    - Create a new Java project. Make sure the JDK is set to Java 8, that is, **JavaSDK-1.8**.
    - Add the following libraries from the `lib` directory of the unzipped Hyper API package as external JARs:
        `tableauhyperapi.jar`
        `tableauhyperapi-windows.jar` (Windows),
        `tableauhyperapi-linux.jar` (Linux),
        `tableauhyperapi-darwin.jar` (macOS)
        `jna-5.6.0.jar`
    - Copy the `hyper` folder from the `lib` directory of the unzipped Hyper API package next to the JARs, as in the example project.
    - To enable proper Javadoc, add the `hapi-javadoc.jar` from the lib directory as the Javadoc archive.


### Java Native Access Library

If your security requirements require you to run Java applications with the system property `jna.nounpack` set to `true`, which disables unpacking from a `.jar` file, you need to obtain the native Hyper API library in another way. While you could extract the library from the `.jar` file in the Java Hyper API package, the easiest way is to download and unzip the C++ Hyper API package for your platform, as described in the following steps:

1. [Download](/docs/releases#download) `hyperapi-cxx` package for your platform.
1. Unzip the package and place the native Hyper API library in a directory or folder accessible by the Java application.
    * For Windows, the native library (`tableauhyperapi.dll`) file is in the `bin` directory of the `.zip` file.
    * For Linux, the library (`libtableauhyperapi.so`) is in the `lib` directory of the `.zip` file.
    * For macOS, the library (`libtableauhyperapi.dylib`) is in the `lib` folder of the `.zip` file.
1. Set system property `jna.library.path` with value set to the absolute path of the folder or directory that contains the native library file for your platform (from step 2).
