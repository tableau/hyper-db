# EXECUTE

â€” execute a prepared statement

## Synopsis

```sql_template
EXECUTE <name> [ (<parameter> [, ...]) ]
```

## Description

`EXECUTE` is used to execute a previously prepared statement. Since
prepared statements only exist for the duration of a session, the
prepared statement must have been created by a [`PREPARE`](prepare)
statement executed earlier in the current session.

If the `PREPARE` statement that created the statement specified some
parameters, a compatible set of parameters must be passed to the
`EXECUTE` statement, or else an error is raised. Note that (unlike
functions) prepared statements are not overloaded based on the type or
number of their parameters; the name of a prepared statement must be
unique within a database session.

For more information on the creation and usage of prepared statements,
see [PREPARE](prepare).

## Parameters

`<name>`

:   The name of the prepared statement to execute.

`<parameter>`

:   The actual value of a parameter to the prepared statement. This must
    be an expression yielding a value that is compatible with the data
    type of this parameter, as was determined when the prepared
    statement was created.

## Examples

Examples are given in the [Examples](prepare#examples) section of the
[PREPARE](prepare) statement.

## Compatibility

The SQL standard includes an `EXECUTE` statement, but it is only for use
in embedded SQL. This version of the `EXECUTE` statement also uses a
somewhat different syntax, derived from PostgreSQL.
