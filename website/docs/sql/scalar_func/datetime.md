# Date/Time Functions and Operators

[Functions](#functions) show the available functions
for date/time value processing, with details appearing in the following
subsections. [Operators](#operators) illustrate the
behaviors of the basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`, etc.). For
formatting functions, refer to [Data Type Formatting Functions](/docs/sql/scalar_func/formatting). You should
be familiar with the background information on date/time data types from
[Date/Time Types](/docs/sql/datatype/datetime).

Most of the functions and operators described below that take `time` or
`timestamp` inputs actually come in two variants: one that takes
`time with time zone` or `timestamp with time zone`, and one that takes
`time without time zone` or `timestamp without time zone`. For brevity,
these variants are not shown separately. Also, the `+` and `*` operators
come in commutative pairs (for example both date + integer and integer +
date); we show only one of each such pair.

:::note
The examples in this section that show `interval` values use a
human-readable style similar to
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#INTERVAL-OUTPUT)
to represent them as strings. However, when outputting interval data as a
string, Hyper uses the [ISO-8601
style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals). An
example of interval in this format is `P1DT2H3M4S`, which corresponds to
1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds.

While all examples here work as expected, please note that when
converting intervals to strings for output, you might see a different
format than what is shown in this page.

## Operators {#operators}

Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are also available for dates, times and intervals.

Operator|Example
---|---
`+`|`date '2001-09-28' + integer '7'` → `date '2001-10-05'`
`+`|`date '2001-09-28' + interval '1 hour'` → `timestamp '2001-09-28 01:00:00'`
`+`|`date '2001-09-28' + time '03:00'` → `timestamp '2001-09-28 03:00:00'`
`+`|`interval '1 day' + interval '1 hour'` → `interval '1 day 01:00:00'`
`+`|`timestamp '2001-09-28 01:00' + interval '23 hours'` → `timestamp '2001-09-29 00:00:00'`
`+`|`time '01:00' + interval '3 hours'` → `time '04:00:00'`
`-`|`- interval '23 hours'` → `interval '-23:00:00'`
`-`|`date '2001-10-01' - date '2001-09-28'` → `integer '3'` (days)
`-`|`date '2001-10-01' - integer '7'` → `date '2001-09-24'`
`-`|`date '2001-09-28' - interval '1 hour'` → `timestamp '2001-09-27 23:00:00'`
`-`|`time '05:00' - time '03:00'` → `interval '02:00:00'`
`-`|`time '05:00' - interval '2 hours'` → `time '03:00:00'`
`-`|`timestamp '2001-09-28 23:00' - interval '23 hours'` → `timestamp '2001-09-28 00:00:00'`
`-`|`interval '1 day' - interval '1 hour'` → `interval '1 day -01:00:00'`
`-`|`timestamp '2001-09-29 03:00' - timestamp '2001-09-27 12:00'` → `interval '1 day 15:00:00'`
`*`|`900 * interval '1 second'` → `interval '00:15:00'`
`*`|`21 * interval '1 day'` → `interval '21 days'`
`*`|`double precision '3.5' * interval '1 hour'` → `interval '03:30:00'`
`/`|`interval '1 hour' / double precision '1.5'` → `interval '00:40:00'`

`year (interval)` → `integer`|Get year (equivalent to `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...)`)|`year(interval '8 years')` → `8`

Subtraction of dates and timestamps can also be complex. One
conceptually simple way to perform subtraction is to convert each value
to a number of seconds using `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)`, then subtract
the results; this produces the number of *seconds* between the two
values. This will adjust for the number of days in each month, timezone
changes, and daylight saving time adjustments. Subtraction of date or
timestamp values with the "`-`" operator returns the number of days
(24-hours) and hours/minutes/seconds between the values, making the same
adjustments. The following queries illustrate the differences in these
approaches. The sample results were produced with `timezone = 'US/Eastern'`;
there is a daylight saving time change between the two dates used:

    SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamptz '2013-07-01 12:00:00') -
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamptz '2013-03-01 12:00:00');
    Result: 10537200

    SELECT (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamptz '2013-07-01 12:00:00') -
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamptz '2013-03-01 12:00:00'))
    / 60 / 60 / 24;
    Result: 121.958333333333

    SELECT timestamptz '2013-07-01 12:00:00' - timestamptz '2013-03-01 12:00:00';
    Result: 121 days 23:00:00


## `EXTRACT` {#datetime-extract}

```sql_template
EXTRACT(<field> FROM <source> [, <fiscal_option> [, ...] ] [, <localized_week_option> [, ...] ])
```

The `extract` function retrieves subfields such as year or hour from
date/time values. `<source>` must be a value expression of type
`timestamp`, `timestamptz`, `time`, or `interval`. (Expressions of type `date` are cast
to `timestamp` and can therefore be used as well.) `<field>` is an
identifier or string that selects what field to extract from the source
value.

The `<fiscal_option>` can only be used when `<source>` is of type
`date`, `timestamp` or `timestamptz`, and `<field>` is one of the
following: `fiscal_week`, `fiscal_month`, `fiscal_quarter`,
`fiscal_year`; see [Fiscal Calendar Options](#fiscal-calendar-options).

The `<localized_week_option>` can only be used when `<source>` is of
type `date`, `timestamp` or `timestamptz`, and `<field>` is
`localized_week`; see [Localized Week Options](#localized-week-options).

The result type of `extract` depends on the given `<field>`:
`numeric(8,6)` for field `second`, `numeric(18,6)` for field `epoch`, and
`integer` for any other field.

The following are valid field names:

`century`
:   The century.
    The first century starts at 0001-01-01 00:00:00 AD, although they
    did not know it at the time. This definition applies to all
    Gregorian calendar countries. There is no century number 0, you go
    from -1 century to 1 century. If you disagree with this, please
    write your complaint to: Pope, Cathedral Saint-Peter of Roma,
    Vatican.

```
SELECT EXTRACT(CENTURY FROM TIMESTAMP '2000-12-16 12:21:13');
Result: 20

SELECT EXTRACT(CENTURY FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 21
```

`day`
:   For `timestamp` values, the day (of the month) field (1 - 31) ; for
    `interval` values, the number of days

```
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 16

SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM INTERVAL '40 days 1 minute');
Result: 40
```

`decade`
:   The year field divided by 10

```
SELECT EXTRACT(DECADE FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 200
```

`dow`
:   The day of the week as Sunday (`0`) to Saturday (`6`).
    Note that `extract`'s day of the week numbering differs from that
    of the `to_char(..., 'D')` function.

```
SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 5
```

`doy`
:   The day of the year (1 - 365/366)

```
SELECT EXTRACT(DOY FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 47
```

`epoch`
:   For `timestamp with time zone` values, the number of seconds since
    1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC (can be negative); for `date` and
    `timestamp` values, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00
    local time; for `interval` values, the total number of seconds in
    the interval

```
SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE '2001-02-16 20:38:40.12-08');
Result: 982384720.12

SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM INTERVAL '5 days 3 hours');
Result: 442800
```

You can convert an epoch value back to a time stamp with
`to_timestamp`:

```
SELECT to_timestamp(982384720.12);
Result: 2001-02-17 04:38:40.12+00
```

`hour`
:   The hour field (0 - 23)

```
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 20
```

`fiscal_month`
:   The month within the fiscal year (1 - 12)

```
SELECT EXTRACT(FISCAL_MONTH FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 2
```

`fiscal_quarter`
:   The quarter within the fiscal year (1 - 4)
```
SELECT EXTRACT(FISCAL_QUARTER FROM TIMESTAMPTZ '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 1
```

`fiscal_week`
:   The week within the fiscal year (1 - 54)
```
SELECT EXTRACT(FISCAL_WEEK FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-12-16 20:38:40');
Result: 50
```

`fiscal_year`
:   The fiscal year
```
SELECT EXTRACT(FISCAL_YEAR FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-12-16 20:38:40');
Result: 2001
```

`isodow`
:   The day of the week as Monday (`1`) to Sunday (`7`).
    This is identical to `dow` except for Sunday. This matches the ISO
    8601 day of the week numbering.

```
SELECT EXTRACT(ISODOW FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-18 20:38:40');
Result: 7
```

`isoyear`
:   The ISO 8601 week-numbering year that the date falls in (not
    applicable to intervals).
    Each ISO 8601 week-numbering year begins with the Monday of the week
    containing the 4th of January, so in early January or late December
    the ISO year may be different from the Gregorian year. See the
    `week` field for more information.

```
SELECT EXTRACT(ISOYEAR FROM DATE '2006-01-01');
Result: 2005

SELECT EXTRACT(ISOYEAR FROM DATE '2006-01-02');
Result: 2006
```

`localized_week`
:   The week within the year with regard to a custom start date, which
    is determined by the parameters `first_day_of_localized_week` and
    `minimal_days_in_localized_first_week`; see
    [Localized Week Options](#localized-week-options) for detailed
    explanation and examples.

`microseconds`
:   The seconds field, including fractional parts, multiplied by 1 000
    000; note that this includes full seconds

```
SELECT EXTRACT(MICROSECONDS FROM TIME '17:12:28.5');
Result: 28500000
```

`millennium`
:   The millennium.
    Years in the 1900s are in the second millennium. The third
    millennium started January 1, 2001.

```
SELECT EXTRACT(MILLENNIUM FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 3
```

`milliseconds`
:   The seconds field, including fractional parts, multiplied by 1000.
    Note that this includes full seconds.

```
SELECT EXTRACT(MILLISECONDS FROM TIME '17:12:28.5');
Result: 28500
```

`minute`
:   The minutes field (0 - 59)

```
SELECT EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 38
```

`month`
:   For `timestamp` values, the number of the month within the year
    (1 - 12) ; for `interval` values, the number of months, modulo 12
    (0 - 11)

```
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 2

SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM INTERVAL '2 years 3 months');
Result: 3

SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM INTERVAL '2 years 13 months');
Result: 1
```

`quarter`
:   The quarter of the year (1 - 4) that the date is in

```
SELECT EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 1
```

`second`

:   The seconds field, including fractional parts (0 - 59; can be 60 on leap seconds)

```
SELECT EXTRACT(SECOND FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 40

SELECT EXTRACT(SECOND FROM TIME '17:12:28.5');
Result: 28.5
```

`timezone`
:   The time zone offset from UTC, measured in seconds. Positive values
    correspond to time zones east of UTC, negative values to zones west
    of UTC. (Technically, Hyper does not use UTC because leap seconds
    are not handled.)

`timezone_hour`
:   The hour component of the time zone offset

`timezone_minute`
:   The minute component of the time zone offset

`week`
:   The number of the ISO 8601 week-numbering week of the year. By
    definition, ISO weeks start on Mondays and the first week of a year
    contains January 4 of that year. In other words, the first Thursday
    of a year is in week 1 of that year.
:   In the ISO week-numbering system, it is possible for early-January
    dates to be part of the 52nd or 53rd week of the previous year, and
    for late-December dates to be part of the first week of the next
    year. For example, `2005-01-01` is part of the 53rd week of year
    2004, and `2006-01-01` is part of the 52nd week of year 2005, while
    `2012-12-31` is part of the first week of 2013. It's recommended to
    use the `isoyear` field together with `week` to get consistent
    results.

```
SELECT EXTRACT(WEEK FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 7
```

`year`

:   The year field. Keep in mind there is no `0 AD`, so subtracting `BC`
    years from `AD` years should be done with care.

```
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 2001
```

The `extract` function is primarily intended for computational
processing. For formatting date/time values for display, see
[Formatting Functions](formatting).

## `date_part` {#datetime-datepart}

The `date_part` function is modeled on the traditional Ingres/PostgresQL
equivalent to the SQL-standard function `extract`:

```sql_template
date_part(<field>, <source> [, <fiscal_option> [, ...] ] [, <localized_week_option> [, ...] ])
```

The `<fiscal_option>` can only be used when `<source>` is of type
`date`, `timestamp` or `timestamptz`, and `<field>` is one of the
following: `fiscal_week`, `fiscal_month`, `fiscal_quarter`,
`fiscal_year`; see [Fiscal Calendar Options](#fiscal-calendar-options).

The `<localized_week_option>` can only be used when `<source>` is of type
`date`, `timestamp` or `timestamptz`, and `<field>` is `localized_week`;
see [Localized Week Options](#localized-week-options).

Note that here the `<field>` parameter needs to be a string
value, not a name. The valid field names for `date_part` are the same as
for `extract`. In contrast to `extract`, the result type of `date_part`
is always `double precision`, independent of the selected field.

```
SELECT date_part('day', TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
Result: 16

SELECT date_part('hour', INTERVAL '4 hours 3 minutes');
Result: 4
```

## `date_trunc` {#datetime-trunc}

The function `date_trunc` is conceptually similar to the `trunc`
function for numbers.

```sql_template
date_trunc(<field>, <source> [, <time_zone>] [, <fiscal_option> [, ...] ] [, first_day_of_localized_week => <value> ])
```

`<source>` is a value expression of type `timestamp`,
`timestamp with time zone`, or `interval`. (Values of type `date` and
`time` are cast automatically to `timestamp` or `interval`, respectively.)
`<field>` selects to which precision to truncate the input value. The
return value is likewise of type `timestamp`, `timestamp with time zone`,
or `interval`, and it has all fields that are less significant than the
selected one set to zero (or one, for day and month).

The `<fiscal_option>` can only be used when `<source>` is of type
`date`, `timestamp` or `timestamptz`, and `<field>` is one of the
following: `fiscal_week`, `fiscal_month`, `fiscal_quarter`,
`fiscal_year`; see [Fiscal Calendar Options](#fiscal-calendar-options).

The parameter `first_day_of_localized_week` can only be used when
`<source>` is of type `date`, `timestamp` or `timestamptz`, and
`<field>` is `localized_week`; see
[Localized Week Options](#localized-week-options).

Valid values for `<field>` are: `microseconds`, `milliseconds`,
`second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `localized_week`,
`fiscal_week`, `month`,
`fiscal_month`, `quarter`, `fiscal_quarter`, `year`, `fiscal_year`,
`decade`, `century`, `millennium`.

If `<source>` is of type `interval`, then `<field>` may not be `week`.
This is because a month may contain a fractional number of weeks, and
thus truncation to weeks is not possible in the general case.

When the input value is of type `timestamp with time zone`, the
truncation is performed with respect to a particular time zone; for
example, truncation to `day` produces a value that is midnight in that
zone. By default, truncation is done with respect to the current time
zone.

A time zone cannot be specified when processing
`timestamp without time zone` or `interval` inputs. These are always
taken at face value.

Examples (assuming the local time zone is `America/New_York`):

    SELECT date_trunc('hour', TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
    Result: 2001-02-16 20:00:00

    SELECT date_trunc('year', TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
    Result: 2001-01-01 00:00:00

    SELECT date_trunc('hour', INTERVAL '3 days 02:47:33');
    Result: 3 days 02:00:00

    SELECT date_trunc('day', TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE '2001-02-16 20:38:40+00');
    Result: 2001-02-16 00:00:00-05

    SELECT date_trunc('fiscal_year', TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40', fiscal_year_start_month => 2);
    Result: 2001-02-01 00:00:00

## Current Date/Time {#datetime-current}

Hyper provides a number of functions that return values related to the
current date and time. These SQL-standard functions all return values
based on the start time of the current statement:

```sql_template
CURRENT_DATE
CURRENT_TIME CURRENT_TIMESTAMP CURRENT_TIME(<precision>)
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(<precision>)
```

The return value of both `CURRENT_TIME` and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` contains
the time zone.

Some examples:

    SELECT CURRENT_TIME;
    Result: 14:39:53.662522-05

    SELECT CURRENT_DATE;
    Result: 2001-12-23

    SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    Result: 2001-12-23 14:39:53.662522-05

All the date/time data types also accept the special literal value `now`
to specify the current date and time. Thus, the following three all
return the same result:

    SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    SELECT now();
    SELECT TIMESTAMP 'now';
    CREATE TABLE a (t TIMESTAMP DEFAULT 'now');

In the fourth example, the current timestamp at time of insertion of a
tuple will be used, and not the timestamp of table creation. This works
differently in PostgreSQL, where the table creation timestamp is used in
every insertion that uses the default value.

## Fiscal Calendar Options {#fiscal-calendar-options}

The fiscal calendar options define the start date of the fiscal
calendar. A fiscal year could differ from a calendar year, and the first
fiscal week, fiscal month or fiscal quarter could also differ from their
calendar counterparts. See
[Define Your Fiscal Year](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.admin_about_cfy.htm&type=5)
for more details. The fiscal calendar options are used for such
cases.

The fiscal calendar options can be used in [EXTRACT](#datetime-extract),
[date_trunc](#datetime-trunc) and [date_part](#datetime-datepart) functions,
when the field for those functions is one of the fiscal fields:

```
fiscal_week
fiscal_month
fiscal_quarter
fiscal_year
```

The following fiscal calendar options are available:

`fiscal_year_start_month => <value>`
:   The month in which the fiscal year starts. If the fiscal year starts
    in February, `<value>` should be `2`. The default value is `1` (January).

`first_day_of_fiscal_week => <value>`
:   The first day of the fiscal week. If the fiscal year starts with
    January, and `<value>` is `1` (Monday), `fiscal_week` on date
    (timestamp) `2023-01-02` will return `2`, since `2023-01-01` is a
    Sunday. The default value is `1` (Monday).

`use_start_date_as_fiscal_year_name => <value>`
:   Whether to use the year of the start date of a fiscal year as its
    fiscal year name. For example, the fiscal year starting at
    `2020-04-01` would be 2020 if `value` is `true`, as the start date
    `2020-04-01` is in year 2020. If `value` is `false`, 2021 would be
    the result. The default value is `true`.

Some examples:

    SELECT EXTRACT(fiscal_week FROM timestamp '2000-01-02 20:38:40', first_day_of_fiscal_week => 7);
    Result: 2

    SELECT EXTRACT(fiscal_year FROM timestamp '2000-02-16 20:38:40', fiscal_year_start_month => 3);
    Result: 1999

    SELECT EXTRACT(fiscal_year FROM timestamp '2000-02-16 20:38:40', use_start_date_as_fiscal_year_name => false);
    Result: 2001

## Localized Week Options {#localized-week-options}

The localized week options can be used to define the start of a week and
a year in [EXTRACT](#datetime-extract), [date_trunc](#datetime-trunc)
and [date_part](#datetime-datepart) functions, when the field is
`localized_week`. The following localized week options are available:

`first_day_of_localized_week => <value>`
:   The first day of the localized week. If `<value>` is 1, every week,
    and every year, will start with a Monday. If `<value>` is 7, the
    week and year will start with a Sunday.

`minimal_days_in_localized_first_week => <value>`
:   This option defines a minimum of how many days in the localized
    first week should be in the new year (according to the Gregorian
    calendar) for it to be qualified as the first week. The start of
    the first week of a year is the first weekday defined by
    `first_day_of_localized_week`, starting with which at least
    `minimal_days_in_localized_first_week` days of the week are in
    that year.

For the examples, consider the following calendar (the date format is
`yyyy-mm-dd`):

Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
2021-12-27|2021-12-28|2021-12-29|2021-12-30|2021-12-31|2022-01-01|2022-01-02
2022-01-03|2022-01-04|2022-01-05|2022-01-06|2022-01-07|2022-01-08|2022-01-09
...|...|...|...|...|...|...
2022-12-26|2022-12-27|2022-12-28|2022-12-29|2022-12-30|2022-12-31|2023-01-01
2023-01-02|2023-01-03|2023-01-04|2023-01-05|2023-01-06|2023-01-07|2023-01-08

The `EXTRACT` function for `localized_week` will have the following results:

    SELECT EXTRACT(localized_week FROM timestamp '2023-01-01', first_day_of_localized_week => 1, minimal_days_in_localized_first_week => 1);
    Result: 1

The first day of a week is set to Monday. The first day of the year 2023
is `2022-12-26`, since this is the first Monday, starting with which
the week has at least 1 day in year 2023.

    SELECT EXTRACT(localized_week FROM timestamp '2023-01-01', first_day_of_localized_week => 1, minimal_days_in_localized_first_week => 2);
    Result: 53

The first day of a week is set to Monday. The first day of the year 2023
is `2023-01-02`, since this is the first Monday, starting with which
the week has at least 2 days in year 2023. For the example above, the
date `2023-01-01` still belongs to year 2022, which starts with
`2021-12-27`, since this is the first Monday, starting with which the
week has at least 2 days in year 2022.

    SELECT EXTRACT(localized_week FROM timestamp '2023-01-01', first_day_of_localized_week => 1, minimal_days_in_localized_first_week => 3);
    Result: 52

The first day of a week is set to Monday. The first day of the year 2023
is `2023-01-02`, since this is the first Monday, starting with which
the week has at least 3 days in year 2023. For the example above, the
date `2023-01-01` still belongs to year 2022, which starts with
`2022-01-03`, since this is the first Monday, starting with which the
week has at least 3 days in year 2022.
