# Scalar Functions and Operators

Hyper provides a large number of functions and operators for the
built-in data types.

If you are concerned about portability then note that most of the
functions and operators described in this chapter, with the exception of
the most trivial arithmetic and comparison operators and some explicitly
marked functions, are not specified by the SQL standard. Some of this
extended functionality is present in other SQL database management
systems, in particular PostgreSQL, and in many cases this functionality
is compatible and consistent between the various database systems.
